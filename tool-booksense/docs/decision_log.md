# Decision Log

This document tracks key architectural and implementation decisions made during the BookSense project development.

## Database Implementation Decision

**Date**: 2023-05-09

**Decision**: Implement SQLite storage backend as a high priority task in Sprint 1

**Context**: 
- The project initially implemented a JSON file storage backend as a simple demonstration
- Team members debated whether to stick with JSON storage or implement a SQLite backend early

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keep JSON storage only**
   - Pros: Simplicity, easy to understand, sufficient for demos
   - Cons: Performance issues with larger datasets, lacks indexing, poor query performance
   
2. **Implement SQLite storage early** (CHOSEN)
   - Pros: Better performance, proper indexing, demonstrates storage abstraction
   - Cons: More complex, additional development time

**Decision Rationale**:
- Implementing SQLite early validates our storage interface abstraction
- Provides educational value by showing two different storage approaches
- Prevents retrofitting database support later when more components depend on storage
- Better demonstrates software engineering best practices

**Participants**:
- Project Lead (User): Approved the decision
- Technical Architect (Claude): Supported SQLite implementation
- Quality Specialist (Gallant): Strongly advocated for SQLite implementation
- Pragmatic Developer (Goofus): Preferred focusing on UI elements first

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Develop SQLite storage implementation following the existing StorageInterface
2. Add indexing for efficient querying
3. Create a storage factory to easily switch between implementations
4. Update the Streamlit interface to allow selection of storage backend

**Success Metrics**:
- Both storage implementations are interchangeable
- Query performance improves for filtered operations
- Educational value of comparing approaches
