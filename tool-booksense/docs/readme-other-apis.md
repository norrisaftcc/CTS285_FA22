## Teaching Considerations

For teaching API concepts effectively:

1. **Start simple**: Begin with APIs that don't require authentication (like PokeAPI or REST Countries)
2. **Progress to authentication**: Move to simple key-based APIs (like NASA) before tackling OAuth flows
3. **Consider content relevance**: Choose APIs related to your students' interests or course material
4. **Assignment scaffolding**: Provide starter code for more complex APIs
5. **Rate limit awareness**: Teach students about checking and respecting rate limits
