# Sprint 1: Core Foundation Tasks

## Project Setup (Day 1-2)

- [x] Create project structure and organization
- [x] Create requirements.txt for core module
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment with required dependencies
- [ ] Configure linting and code style tools (flake8, black)
- [ ] Set up basic unit testing framework (pytest)
- [x] Create initial documentation structure

## Data Model Implementation (Day 3-5)

- [x] Define Book class with all required attributes
- [x] Implement data validation for Book attributes
- [x] Create serialization/deserialization methods (to/from dict)
- [x] Add helper methods for book comparison and display
- [ ] Write unit tests for Book model
- [x] Document the data model with examples

## Storage Layer (Day 6-10)

- [x] Define storage interface/abstract class
- [x] Implement JSON file storage backend
  - [x] Create methods for reading entire collection
  - [x] Add methods for writing collection to file
  - [x] Implement transaction support (to prevent data corruption)
- [x] Add error handling for file operations
- [ ] Implement SQLite storage backend (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - [ ] Create table schema for books
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations using SQL
  - [ ] Add indexing for efficient queries
  - [ ] Implement transaction support
- [ ] Write unit tests for storage implementations
- [ ] Create storage documentation with comparison between JSON and SQLite approaches
- [ ] Create a storage factory to easily switch between implementations

## Operations Layer (Day 11-14)

- [x] Create BookCollection class to manage book operations
- [x] Implement CRUD operations:
  - [x] Add new book
  - [x] Get book by ID
  - [x] Update existing book
  - [x] Delete book
- [x] Add collection operations:
  - [x] List all books
  - [x] Filter books by attributes
  - [x] Sort books by different fields
  - [x] Search books by text
- [x] Implement basic statistics methods
- [ ] Write unit tests for all operations
- [x] Document the operations layer

## Integration and Review (Day 15-16)

- [x] Create simple example scripts demonstrating core functionality
- [ ] Update Streamlit interface to use the core module
- [ ] Add storage selection option in Streamlit interface
- [ ] Review code for consistency and quality
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass and coverage is adequate
- [ ] Complete documentation for Sprint 1 deliverables
- [ ] Prepare for Sprint 2 (Streamlit Interface Enhancement)

## Definition of Done

- All code passes linting and style checks
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Example scripts work as expected
- Both storage implementations (JSON and SQLite) are functional
- Storage backend can be switched without changing application code
- Code review has been completed
