## Technical Architecture (2 minutes)

*[Slide: Application Design]*

"Dataman follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Models**: Problem and ProblemSet classes that encapsulate math operations
- **Storage Interface**: Flexible persistence with JSON and SQLite implementations using the factory pattern
- **Operations**: Business logic for problem management and validation
- **User History**: Tracking user performance with the singleton pattern
- **UI Interfaces**: Multiple interfaces with CLI and Streamlit web app

This architecture allows for maximum flexibility and extensibility while maintaining clean, maintainable code."

## Live Demo (5-6 minutes)

*[Switch to application]*

"Now, let's see Dataman in action:

1. **Starting the App**: First, I'll start the Streamlit application to show the web interface
2. **Answer Checker**: Let's try a few problems in the Answer Checker
   - Demonstrate correct and incorrect answers
   - Show immediate feedback and achievement notifications
3. **Problem Sets**: Creating and working with problem sets
   - Generate a random problem set
   - Solve problems from the set
   - Save the problem set for later use
4. **Timed Drill**: Complete a brief timed drill
   - Set up a drill with custom settings
   - Solve a few problems
   - Review the results and statistics
5. **Theme Switching**: Switch between Dataman and Little Professor themes
6. **User History**: Explore the user history dashboard
   - View performance statistics and charts
   - Check earned achievements
   - Review learning suggestions"
