# PokeSense Design Document

## Object Model

At the heart of PokeSense is the Pokemon object model. Based on the BookSense approach, we've defined a clear model that serves as the foundation for the entire application.

### Pokemon Class

```python
@dataclass
class Pokemon:
    name: str                          # Pokemon name (e.g., "Pikachu")
    pokemon_id: int                    # PokeAPI ID (e.g., 25)
    types: List[str]                   # Pokemon types (e.g., ["electric"])
    sprites: Dict[str, str]            # URLs to various sprite images
    height: int                        # Height in decimeters
    weight: int                        # Weight in hectograms
    stats: List[Dict[str, any]]        # List of stats (hp, attack, etc.)
    abilities: List[str]               # Pokemon abilities
    moves: List[str]                   # Pokemon moves
    favorite: bool                     # User preference marker
    notes: str                         # User-added notes
    id: str                            # Unique collection entry ID
    date_added: datetime               # When added to collection
```

## Application Architecture

PokeSense follows a clear three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│     GUI     │ ↔  │    Logic    │ ↔  │    Data     │
│  (Streamlit)│    │   (Core)    │    │  (Storage)  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

### 1. Data Layer

The data layer handles persistence and retrieval of Pokemon data:

- **StorageInterface**: Abstract base class defining storage operations
- **JsonStorage**: Concrete implementation using JSON files
  - Handles CRUD operations for Pokemon objects
  - Manages serialization between Pokemon objects and JSON

### 2. Business Logic Layer

The business logic layer manages Pokemon collections and API integration:

- **PokemonCollection**: Manages a collection of Pokemon with operations for:
  - Adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting Pokemon
  - Searching and filtering Pokemon
  - Sorting Pokemon by various attributes
  - Generating collection statistics

- **PokeApiService**: Handles integration with the external PokeAPI:
  - Searching for Pokemon
  - Retrieving detailed Pokemon information
  - Extracting and normalizing API data
  - Implementing caching to minimize API calls

### 3. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer provides the user interface using Streamlit:

- **Streamlit App**: Web-based interface for:
  - Searching for Pokemon
  - Viewing Pokemon details
  - Managing a Pokemon collection
  - Analyzing collection data

## Data Flow

1. **API Integration Flow**:
   ```
   User search → PokeApiService → API request → API response → 
   Extract data → Present results
   ```

2. **Collection Management Flow**:
   ```
   Add Pokemon → PokemonCollection → JsonStorage → 
   Write to file → Update UI
   ```

3. **Filtering and Search Flow**:
   ```
   User filter → PokemonCollection → Apply filters → 
   Return filtered list → Update UI
   ```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear boundaries between data, logic, and presentation
   - Independent components that can be tested in isolation

2. **Data Model**
   - Rich Pokemon model that extends the PokeAPI data
   - User-specific fields for collection management
   - Validation to ensure data integrity

3. **API Integration**
   - Caching to prevent redundant API calls
   - Error handling for network issues
   - Data normalization for consistent presentation

4. **Storage Strategy**
   - File-based JSON storage for simplicity
   - Abstract interface allowing for alternative implementations
   - Transaction-like approach to prevent data corruption

5. **UI Design**
   - Responsive grid layout for Pokemon cards
   - Type-specific color coding
   - Visual statistics using progress bars
   - Expandable sections for detailed information

## Future Extensibility

The design allows for several extension points:

1. **Alternative Storage Backends**
   - Implement new storage classes that conform to the StorageInterface
   - Potential for SQLite, MongoDB, or cloud storage

2. **Enhanced API Integration**
   - Expand to include other Pokemon-related APIs
   - Add support for evolutionary chains and relationships

3. **Advanced UI Features**
   - Team building with type coverage analysis
   - Battle simulation based on Pokemon stats
   - Data visualization for collection analysis

4. **Mobile Support**
   - Progressive web app capabilities
   - Responsive design for various device sizes
