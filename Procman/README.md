# README.md - ProcMan

ProcMan is a reimplementation of Dataman using only procedural programming techniques, as much as possible.

Usage

Different branches will hold different iterations.

Iter1 - Everything in one file. Methods are labeled based on whether they are part of the UI or Logic implementation.

Iter2 - Split UI and Logic into separate modules, imported by main.
